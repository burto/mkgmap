<h3>Filesystem implementation</h3>
<p>This holds the filesystem implementation for the .img
format.  I refer through out to a file system containing
files, rather than using the term <em>sub-files</em> as in John Mechalas'
document.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it (and probably a better one) is that it a kind
	of archive format just like a .zip file.
