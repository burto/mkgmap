<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This package creates the MDR file.

<p>There are many, many possible sections in the file.  We will attempt
	to find the minimum number required to make something work.

<h2>Sections to be implemented first</h2>
<p>Use a header of size 286.
	This gives us the possibility of the first 19 sections.
<p>
	Initial sections to implement: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 15.

	Of these 4 and 6 are not known and only some subsection of MDR 1 are
	also not known.
