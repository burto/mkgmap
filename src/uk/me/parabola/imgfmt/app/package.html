<h3>Application files</h3>
This package and its subpackages contain the application files that appear
in the IMG file-system.

<p>The files that will be supported are</p>
<dl>
    <dt>TRE</dt>
    <dd>The tree view of the map that is needed to make sense of
        the rest of the file. A map is divided into a number of different levels
        of detail. At each level of detail it is divided into a number of areas
        (called sub-divisions here. In general there will be more sub-divisions
        at the better zoom levels. Each subdivision points to the ones in the
        zoom level below it.
    </dd>

    <dt>RGN</dt>
    <dd>This file contains the definitions of the points, lines and polygons.
        They have to be read in conjunction with the <strong>TRE</strong> section however,
        as they don't make sense by themselves.
    </dd>

    <dt>LBL</dt>
    <dd>This file contains all the text lables. Other
        files refer to the labels that are defined in this file.
    </dd>
