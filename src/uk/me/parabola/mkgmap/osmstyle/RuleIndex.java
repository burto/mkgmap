/**
 * An index to reduce the number of rules that have to be executed.
 *
 * <p>Only the first term (after rearrangement) of the rule is used in the
 * index.  This will (currently) always be an EQUALS or EXISTS (A=B or A=*).
 *
 * <p>We look at the tags of the element and pick out all rules that have the
 * first term that matches the tag=value and tag=*, this is done by a single
 * lookup for each tag in the element (on average a low number such as 3).
 *
 * <p>So if the element had the one tag highway=primary and the rules were as
 * follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 1  surface=good { ... }
 * 2  highway=secondary { set fence=no; }
 * 3  highway=primary { set surface=good; }
 * 4  highway=* & abc=yes { }
 * 5  surface=good { }
 * 6  oneway=yes & highway=primary { }
 * </pre>
 *
 * We would select rules 3 and 4.  No other rule can match initially. But there
 * is a problem; rule 3 if matched could set the surface tag.  So we also
 * need to select rule 5.  Rule 1 can not be matched because it occurs before
 * the rule that sets the tag, so it is not included.  All this is precomputed
 * when the index is created, so we can still do a single lookup.
 *
 * <p>So the full set of rules that we need to match is 3, 4 and 5.
 * If rule 5 itself set a tag, then we might have to add more rules and
 * so on.
