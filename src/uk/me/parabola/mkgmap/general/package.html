<h3>Generic map types</h3>
<p>Here we have the general map types that are used to build the map.
    Other data sources, such as the OSM reader, have to convert to
    this format.
<p>Note that this is the most detailed representation of the map.
    We use this intermediate form, because a Garmin map has (or can have)
    different levels of zoom which will be at different levels of detail.
<p>So we go through this <em>general</em> representation to construct the
    actual representations at each level.  These actual representations will
    use objects from the @{link uk.me.parabola.imgfmt.app} package, and
    they may have a different number of points to this general representation.
    Indeed they may have different points all together since we may take the
    average of several points in the general representation</p>
