<h3>Polish format input file format</h3>
<p>This is the input file reader for the <em>Polish</em> format.
This is the input format for <a href="http://www.cgpsmapper.com">cGPSmapper</a> and
is also by several other map editing tools.</p>

<p>As the polish format is designed for representing Garmin maps, it is very
easy to read it into mkgmap, in fact I was a bit suprised how it all just
worked.

<p>Having said that, this is just a basic implementation and many of the
command tags in the format are just ignored.</p>

<p>It is a good starting point for someone that is wanting to write a new
input file plugin for mkgmap as there are no complicating requirements.
