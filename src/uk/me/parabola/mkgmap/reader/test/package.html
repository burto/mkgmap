<h3>Test maps</h3>

<p>This is an example of a map data source that does not read anything in from
a file at all.  It generates the maps with code.

<p>The mapnames begin with <em>TEST:</em> the only one implemented at the time
	of writing was TEST:ALL-ELEMENTS.  This is a map that contains grids of
	points, lines and polygons all with different types.
