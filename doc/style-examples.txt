===Alternatives===
Two or more things resolve to the same thing in the garmin map.

 highway=footway | highway=path [0x16 level 1]

This is exacly the same as writing the two lines:
 highway=footway [0x16 level 1]
 highway=path [0x16 level 1]


===White space===
Space and new lines don't matter except to separate words that have to be
separate.
You can add as much space and as many newlines to the rule to make
it look good.  Or remove them depending on taste.  For example:

 highway = primary 
   | highway=primary_link
 [
 	0x2
	level 3
 ]

 highway=primary|highway=primary_link[0x2 level 3]
