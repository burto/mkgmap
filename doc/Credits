General
-------
This project is almost entirely based on the file format specification
document written by John Mechalas at the SourceForge project at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/garmin-img.  The 'imgdecode' program
from the same source was also very important in checking that I was
on the right lines to producing a correct file.

POI support
-----------
Bernhard Heibler: support for filling in address, phone etc information
into POI based on tags in the .osm file.
Also automatically finding city information by various means including
