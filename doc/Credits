General
-------
This project is almost entirely based on the file format specification
document written by John Mechalas at the SourceForge project at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/garmin-img.  The 'imgdecode' program
from the same source was also very important in checking that I was
on the right lines to producing a correct file.

Map features
------------
The original map features file was based on the files in OSMGarminMap
by Jochen Topf.  The current file was also created by Jochen Topf.

Additions have been made by a number of people notably by:
Elrond, Roozbeh, Computerteddy
