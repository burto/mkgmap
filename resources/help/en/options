General options:

--help=topic
	Print help on the given topic.  If the topic is omitted then a
	list of all the help topics is printed instead.

--version 
	Output program version.

filename
--input-file=filename
	Read input data from the give file.  This option (or just a
	filename) may be given more than once.

--gmapsupp
	Write a gmapsupp.img file that can be uploaded to a Garmin or
	placed in "/Garmin" in a microSD card (such as by mounting the
	device in USB mass storage mode).
	TODO: explain if this is in addition to or instead of the
	per-input files.

-c filename
--read-config=filename
	The given file is opened and each line is an option setting of
	the form option=value, any option that could be used on the command
	line can be used, however you omit the leading '--'.  The short
	option names with a single '-' cannot be used, simply use the
	long name instead.

-n name
--mapname=name
	Set the name of the map. Garmin maps are named by 8 digit
	numbers.  The default is 63240001.  It is best to use a different
	name if you are going to be making a map for others to use so
	that it is unique and does not clash with others.

--description=text
	Sets the descriptive text for the map. This may be displayed in
	QLandkarte, MapSource on on a GPS etc, where it is normally shown
	below the family name. Example: --description="Germany, Denmark"
	Please note: if you use splitter.jar to build a template.args file
	and use -c template.args, then that file may contain a
	"description" that will override this option. Use "--description" in
	splitter.jar to change the description in the template.args file.

--country-name=name
	Sets the map's country name. The default is "COUNTRY".

--country-abbr=abbreviation
	Sets the map's abbreviated country name. The default is "ABC".

--region-name=name
	Sets the map's region name. By default, the map has no region name.

--region-abbr=abbreviation
	Sets the map's abbreviated region name. By default, the map has
	no abbreviated region name.

Label options:

--charset=name
	This option allows the use of non-ascii characters in street
	names. It is hardware dependant what is actually supported on
	a particular device. Some devices can only do ascii characters
	for example.

	Mkgmap goes to some length to convert un-displayable characters
	however and by default (without this option) it will transliterate
	characters to unaccented ascii characters where possible.

--latin1
	This is equivalent to --charset=latin1.

--code-page=number
	TODO: is one really supposed to give two single quotes?
	Write the given code page number to the header of the LBL file. 
	Some examples on the mailing list use --code-page=1252.
	TODO: explain what this does, and why one would or would not want
	to do it.

--lower-case
	Allow labels to contain lower case letters.  Note that this
	doesn't work on many (most, all?) Garmin devices.

Style options:

--style=name
	Specify a different style name, rather than the default value
	(which is the word default).

--style-file=file
	Specify an external file to obtain the style from.  "file" can
	be a directory containing files such as info, lines, options
	(see resources/styles/default for an example).  The directory
	path must be absolute or relative to the current working
	directory when mkgmap is invoked.

	The file can be a zip file instead of a directory.  TODO-check
	this: In this case, the zip file should contain directories
	with styles, and the style 'default' will be used, unless the
	--style option is also given to select a different one.

	The argument can also be a URL, in which case TODO.

	For backward compatibility, you can also supply a
	map-features.csv file here.  See the customisation help.

--list-styles
	List the available styles.

--levels=levels code
	Change the way that the levels on the map correspond to the
	zoom levels in the device. See customisation help. The default
	is the equivalent of: "0=24, 1=22, 2=21, 3=19, 4=18, 5=16"
	although this may change.

--name-tag-list
	Get the tag that will be used to supply the name.  Useful for
	language variations.  You can supply a list and the first one
	will be used.  eg. --name-tag-list=name:en,int_name,name

--map-features=file
	This option is obsolete; use the --style-file option instead.

Product description options:

--family-id
	This is an integer that identifies a family of products.

--family-name
	If you build several maps, this option describes the
	family name of all of your maps. Garmin will display this
	in the map selection screen.
	Example: --family-name="OpenStreetmap mkgmap XL 2019"
	TODO: at least the "-" character seems to have a strange
	effect on the family name; latin-alphabet and digits seem
	safe, but other characters should be checked.

--product-id
	This is an integer that identifies a product within a family.
	It is often just 1.

--series-name
--area-name

--overview-mapname=name
	If --tdbfile is enabled, this gives the name of the overview
	.img and .tdb files. The default map name is OSM_map
	
--overview-mapnumber=8 digit number
	If --tdbfile is enabled, this gives the internal 8 digit
	number used in the overview map and tdb file.  The default
	number is 63240000.
	

Miscellaneous options:

--max-jobs[=number]
	When number is specified, allow that number of maps to be
	processed concurrently. If number is not specified, the limit
	is set equal to the number of CPU cores. If this option is not
	given at all, the limit is 1 (i.e., the maps are processed
	sequentially).

--keep-going
	Don't quit whole application if an exception occurs while
	processing a job - continue to process the other jobs.

--block-size=number
	Changes the block size that is used in the generated map.
	TODO: explain what this meant
	Use of this option is not recommended.

--net
	Create maps that supports the "lock to road" option.

--route
	Experimental: Create maps that support routing.  This implies --net
	(so that --net need not be given if --route is given).

--drive-on-left
--drive-on-right
	Explicitly specify which side of the road vehicles are
	expected to drive on. If neither of these options are
	specified, it is assumed that vehicles drive on the right
	unless --check-roundabouts is specified and the first
	roundabout processed is clockwise.

--check-roundabouts
	Check that roundabouts have the expected direction (clockwise
	when vehicles drive on the left). Roundabouts that are complete
	loops and have the wrong direction are reversed.

--ignore-maxspeeds
	When reading OSM files, ignore any "maxspeed" tags.

--ignore-turn-restrictions
	When reading OSM files, ignore any "restriction" relations.

--ignore-osm-bounds
	When reading OSM files, ignore any "bounds" elements.

--preserve-element-order
	Process the map elements (nodes, ways, relations) in the order
	in which they appear in the OSM input. Without this option,
	the order in which the elements are processed is not defined.

--remove-short-arcs[=MinLength]
	Merge nodes to remove short arcs that can cause routing
	problems. If MinLength is specified (in metres), arcs shorter
	than that length will be removed. If a length is not
	specified, only zero-length arcs will be removed.

--adjust-turn-headings
	Where possible, ensure that turns off to side roads change
	heading sufficiently so that the GPS believes that a turn is
	required rather than a fork. This also avoids spurious
	instructions to "keep right/left" when the road doesn't
	actually fork.

--road-name-pois[=GarminCode]
	Generate a POI for each named road. By default, the POIs'
	Garmin type code is 0x640a. If desired, a different type code
	can be specified with this option.  This is a workaround for not
	being able to search for roads.
	
--add-pois-to-areas
	Generate a POI for each area. The POIs are created after the
	style is applied and only for polygon types that have a
	reasonable point equivalent.

--make-poi-index
	Generate the POI index (not yet useful).

--make-all-cycleways
	Turn on all of the options that make cycleways.

--make-opposite-cycleways
	Some oneway streets allow bicycle traffic in the reverse
	direction and this option makes a way with the same points as
	the original that allows bicycle traffic (in both directions).

--make-cycleways
	Some streets have a separate cycleway track/lane just for
	bicycle traffic and this option makes a way with the same
	points as the original that allows bicycle traffic. Also,
	bicycle traffic is prohibited from using the original way
	(unless that way's bicycle access has been defined).

--link-pois-to-ways
	If this option is enabled, POIs that are situated at a point
	in a way will be associated with that way and may modify the
	way's properties. Currently supported are POIs that restrict
	access (e.g. bollards). Their access restrictions are applied
	to a small region of the way near the POI.

--delete-tags-file=FILENAME
	Names a file that should contain one or more lines of the form
	TAG=VALUE or TAG=*. Blank lines and lines that start with
	# or ; are ignored. All tag/value pairs in the OSM input are
	compared with these patterns and those that match are deleted.

--tdbfile
	Write a .tdb file.

--draw-priority=25
	When two maps cover the same area, this option controls what
	order they are drawn in and therefore which map is on top of
	which.  Higher priorities are drawn "on top" of lower
	priorities.

--transparent
	Make the map transparent, so that if two maps are loaded that
	cover the same area, you can see through this map and see the
	lower map too.  Useful for contour line maps among other
	things.

--no-poi-address
	Disable address / phone information to POIs. Address info is
	read according to the "Karlsruhe" tagging schema. Automatic
	filling of missing information could be enabled using the
	"location-autofill" option.

--no-sorted-roads
	Suppress the normal generation of sorted road data. This will
	make the map quicker to build but the find address or
	intersection functions will be lost.

--location-autofill=''number''
	Controls how country region info is gathered for cities /
	streets and pois

	0 	(Default) The country region info is gathered by
		analysis of the cities is_in tags.

		If no country region info is present the default
		passed default country region is used.
		 
	1	Additional analysis of partial is_in info to get
		relations between hamlets and cities
	
	2	Brute force search for nearest city with info if all
		methods before failed. Warning cities my end up in the
		wrong country/region.
		
	3	Enables debug output about suspicious relations that
		might cause wrong country region info
