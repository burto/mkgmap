Options:

--help=topic
	Print help on the given topic.  The topic is omitted then a list of
	all the help topics is printed instead.

-c filename
	The given file is opened and each line is an option setting of the form
	option=value, just like on the command line except that there is no
	leading '--'. 

-n name
--mapname=name
	Change the name of the map. Garmin maps are named by 8 digit numbers.
	The default is 63240001. It is best to change the name if you are going
	to be making a map for others to use so that it is unique and does not
	clash with others. 

--description=text
	Sets the descriptive text for the map. This may be displayed in
	QLandkarte, MapSource on on a GPS etc. 

Label options:

--latin1
	This option allows the use of non-ascii characters in street names. It
	is hardware dependant what is actually supported on a particular
	device. Some devices can only do ascii characters for example. 

	Mkgmap goes to some length to convert un-displayable characters
	however and by default (without this option) it will transliterate
	characters to unaccented ascii characters where possible.

--charset=''name''
	Use the specified character set.

--code-page=''number''
	Use the given code page for the .  This is 

--lower-case
	Allow labels to contain lower case letters.  Note that this doesn't
	work on many (most, all?) Garmin devices.

Style options:

--style=name
	Specify a different style name, rather than the default.

--style-file=file
	Specify an external file to obtain the style from.  "file" can be a
	directory or a zip file containing the style.  It can also be a URL.
	If there is more than one style in the zip file, then the --style
	argument can be used to select.

	For backward compatibility, you can also supply a map-features.csv file
	here.  See the customisation help.

--list-styles
	List the avaialble styles.

--levels=levels code
	Change the way that the levels on the map correspond to the zoom levels
	in the device. See customisation help. The default is the equivalent
	of: "0=24, 1=22, 2=21, 3=19, 4=18, 5=16" although this may change. 

--name-tag-list
	Get the tag that will be used to supply the name.  Useful for language
	variations.  You can supply a list and the first one will be used.
	eg. --name-tag-list=name:en,int_name,name

--map-features=file
	Outdated option, use the --style-file option now.

Product description options:

--family-id
	This is an integer that identifies a family of products.

--product-id
	This is an integer that identifies a product within a family.  It
	is often just 1.

--series-name
--family-name
--area-name
--overview-name

Misc options:
--block-size=''number''

	general reason why you would want to do this.

--gmapsupp
	Write a gmapsupp.img file that can be uploaded to a garmin in
	usb mode.

--tdbfile
